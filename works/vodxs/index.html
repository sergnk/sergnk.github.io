						The Visual On Demand Experience is the brainchild of the Scott Brown.  His passion started in the late 90’s, in general contracting and plumbing design.  After several patents and successful partnerships and licensing opportunities.  Fast forward to 2011, the concept of VODXS<span class="tm">&trade;</span> was conceived as a Digital Display Water Faucet System with his co-founding partner Cory Galakatos.  By 2012 a patent was issued, US D670,664 S, for the Visual On Demand Experience System.<br><br>
						It might not be all that obvious that a company who manufactures and distributes a patented faucet with an integrated LCD Screen world-wide would be in a position to disrupt the advertising industry through blockchain technologies, but often the best ideas come from outside their domains and strategic positioning of technology, relationships and locations.<br><br>
						VODXS<span class="tm">&trade;</span> is Universal Global Technology and media service provider, specializing in digital video advertising in stadiums, resorts, conference centers, casinos and other high traffic venues with the primary focus on “cleaning up” digital advertising with increased efficiency, transparency, cost reduction, and the elimination of fraud.

						In 2014, VODXS<span class="tm">&trade;</span> went mainstream with connected faucet. Deployed in various locations, including Caesars Harrah’s Casino Properties, streaming video ads was deemed a success during interviews with various people, and the establishment that bought the first units.<br><br>
						Today, more has over 1,000 active VODXSmartpoints are in 13 different countries with demand growing daily equaling over 17,000,000+ high value active engagements annually.

He consistently excels at taking on considerable challenges placed in front of him, and not only exceeds expectations, but his insight often enables him to recognize and reveal additional, previously-unexpected benefits to his clients.
				Most recently, Mr. Hanes specialized in developing successful Customer Relationship Management programs for Verizon Wireless, leveraging big data and analytics for customer analysis, segmentation and targeting, and ongoing performance measurement. Such programs, both reactive and proactive across digital and social channels, effectively identified and addressed all challenges associated with CRM, including competitive churn by high-risk customers, and upgrade potential of high-value customers, while delivering optimal retail and call center customer experiences.<br>
				Also with Verizon, Hanes was instrumental in the placement, launch and monetization of mobile advertising on the Verizon Wireless network. Concurrently, he was the cross-functional product lead of the team that launched home-screen mobile advertising and messaging applications. Initially considered a potential threat to customer experience and satisfaction by pushing messages to subscribers, these platforms not only generated significant advertising revenue for Verizon, but also resulted in considerable cost savings, as it educated customers on simple, self-serve methods to manage their own accounts without the assistance of Verizon call center reps. It was for this initiative that Mark was recognized and awarded the 2009 Mobile Excellence Award for Best Mobile Delivery Platform.<br>
				Prior to his tenure at Verizon, Hanes’ career focused on strategic media planning within the top advertising agencies in the world, including Ogilvy & Mather, Foote, Cone & Belding, and Grey Global Group.

Having recently moved to the west coast from New York City, in his off hours Mark can be found at the beach – likely biking…but only if he can’t find a good beach volleyball game first – doubles only…because well, it’s just more challenging that way!
